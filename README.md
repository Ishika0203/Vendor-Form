# Vendor-Form

Vendor Registration Form Project Report
Overview : 
This project is a pivotal component of my ongoing internship at Central Electronics Limited. Our assignment revolves around the development of a Vendor Registration Form, tailored to allow vendors to register their companies by providing the necessary details. The aim is to streamline the vendor onboarding process and enhance data management.
# Backend Development
Technology Stack
For the backend development, I strategically employed Node.js as the server-side runtime environment and MySQL as the database management system.
Core Backend Functionalities
Vendor Data Collection: The backend system is responsible for seamlessly collecting and storing vendor data. This includes basic company information, contact details, financial data, and compliance-related information.

Sectional Data Entry: Recognizing the complexity of vendor registration, we have implemented a logical breakdown of the form into 27 sections. Vendors can navigate these sections at their convenience, entering the required information progressively.
API Integration: The backend exposes a set of well-defined APIs that the frontend, built using ASP.NET, utilizes to communicate with the server. Axios, a popular JavaScript library, facilitates these API calls, ensuring seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend.

Vendor Registration Form project represents the core foundation for efficient vendor onboarding and data management. Leveraging the power of Node.js and MySQL, it offers scalability, performance, and data organization tailored to Central Electronics Limited's specific needs.
